introduction
a
variety
of
glossaries
of
haitian
creole
have
been
published
either
as
appendices
to
descriptions
of
haitian
creole
or
as
booklets.
as
far
as
fullfledged
haitian
creole-english
dictionaries
are
concerned,
only
one
has
been
published
and
it
is
now
more
than
ten
years
old.
it
is
the
compilers’
hope
that
this
new
dictionary
will
go
a
long
way
toward
filling
the
vacuum
existing
in
modern
creole
lexicography.
innovations
the
following
new
features
have
been
incorporated
in
this
haitian
creoleenglish
dictionary.
1.
the
definite
article
that
usually
accompanies
a
noun
is
indicated.
we
urge
the
user
to
take
note
of
the
definite
article
singular
(
a,
la,
an
or
lan
)
which
is
shown
for
each
noun.
lan
has
one
variant:
nan.
2.
most
english
words
that
are
of
the
same
origin
as
creole
words
are
marked
with
an
asterisk
(*).
this
feature
will
help
users
to
recognize
more
easily
creole
words
that
are
identical
or
close
to
their
english
counterparts.
3.
an
english
translation
is
supplied
for
the
numerous
creole
sentences
that
serve
as
examples.
in
addition
to
the
regular
examples,
selected
literary
illustrations
are
provided.
these
are
sentences
taken
from
eighteen
selected
works
of
creole
literature
(novels,
plays,
poetry,
religious
writings,
etc.).
the

headwords
and
variants
because
the
process
of
standardization
of
haitian
creole
is
not
complete,
many
headwords
have
several
variants,
and
often
the
compilers
have
had
to
decide
which
ones
to
choose.
superscript

(

of
the
letter
“a”.
only
two
observations
are
necessary.
a)
french
and
creole
dictionaries
designate
some
verbs
as
pronominal
verbs
(abbreviation:
vpr).
the
user
of
this
dictionary
should
remember
that
vpr
stands
for
vèb
pronominal
(pronominal
verb).
b)
creole
uses
as
descriptive
adjectives
many
of
the
french
descriptive
adjectives
and
has
created
others
which
are
easily
identifiable.
but
in
creole
a
great
number
of
other
words
or
groups
of
words
are
treated
as
descriptive
adjectives
by
commonly
being
used
with
an
attributive
function.
in
the
present
state
of
research,
one
cannot
always
tell
with
absolute
certainty
those
creole
words
used
as
attributives,
which
are
purely
descriptive
adjectives,
and
those
which
are
not.
for
instance,
félix
morisseau-leroy
wrote
in
his
play
antigone,
gan
chèf
ki
chèf
pase
chèf
(there
are
chiefs
who
are
more
chief
than
other
chiefs).
evidently,
while
the
word
chèf
in
the
middle
is
attributive,
it
is
not
a
descriptive
adjective
but
a
noun.
however,
not
all
cases
are
as
clear-cut
as
this
one.
more
research
on
creole’s
descriptive
adjectives
is
necessary.
in
the
meantime,
we
borrow
from
a
predecessor
the
designation
attrib
for
both
descriptive
adjectives
and
closely
related
words
used
as
attributives.
single
and
compound
words
while
single
words
will
be
easy
to
find
in
any
creole
dictionary,
it
is
a
different
matter
when
it
comes
to
compound
words.
the
difficulty
lies
with
the
fact
that
some
concepts
which
are
expressed
in
french
by
compound
words
(arc-en-ciel
=
rainbow)
or
by
groups
of
words
(mal
de
tête
=
headache)
become
a
single
word
in
creole
(lakansyèl,
maltèt).
there
is
a
general
tendency
for
writers
to
put
together
as
one
word
in
creole
all
of
these
groups
of
french
words
that
form
one
single
concept
or
one
tightly
connected
expression,
but
the
process
is
still
on-going.
what
one
author
writes
as
one
word,
another
still
considers
as
two.
sometimes
the
same
author
connects
or
disconnects
the
parts
of
a
compound
word
or
of
an
expression
according
to
the
inspiration
of
the
moment.
for
instance,
the
great
innovator
franketienne
wrote
the
following
sentences.
in
his
play,
pèlin-tèt:
ou
konn
gou
dyòl
ou.
ou
pa
tap
janm
ale
lan
you
estasyon
soulèzèl.
in
his
novel,
dézafi:
sou
lèzèl,
nou
ravitaye
lan
pousyè
nan
labou
anba
solèy
anba
lapli.
in
the
play,
he
wrote
soulèzèl
as
one
word;
in
the
novel,
as
two.
until
creole
becomes
fully
standardized,
each
lexicographer
will
have
to
make
choices.
other
features
iv
a)
in
the
cases
when
we
use
the
(‘)
sign
between
single
letter
personal
pronouns
and
the
following
or
preceding
word
(e.g.,
m’a
wè’l
=
i’ll
see
him),
other
authors
use
a
hyphen
(-)
or
no
sign
at
all.
b)
we
have
used
the
creole
spelling
vodou
in
the
english
definitions
in
place
of
the
english
word
voodoo,
because
we
are
referring
to
the
vodou
religion
and
not
the
hocus
pocus
of
magic
and
witchcraft
attached
to
the
english
word
voodoo.
c)
the
standard
form
of
haitian
creole
is
the
one
spoken
in
port-au-prince,
the
capital.
a
few
colloquial
words
from
other
areas
(the
north,
the
city
of
jérémie
in
the
south)
have
been
added.
we
gratefully
acknowledge
the
help
we
received
from
emile
célestin-mégie,
rev.
roger
désir,
mrs.
jacqueline
julien
targète,
and
many
others.
any
corrections
or
suggestions
will
be
taken
into
account
and
gratefully
acknowledged
in
a
future
edition.
